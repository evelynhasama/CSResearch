    - During my search for the best camera for photogrammetry, the best camera type appeared to be DSLR or Mirrorless cameras. When narrowing down my search, I found that the Nikkon D3500 and the Canon EOS Rebel SL2 or SL3 were the most popular DSLR and for photogrammetry. Due to the differences in prices and similar quality, the camera selected is the Nikon D3500, which is a both affordable and good quality DSLR camera for beginners.
