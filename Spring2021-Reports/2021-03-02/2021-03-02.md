# Activities

## Photogrammetry:

- Read articles to collect more information on Meshroom photgrammetry techniques:
  - Notes:
    - Take photos around 12pm, ideally on a cloudy day
    - Photos need a ton of overlap (at least 50%). It’s best to use a non-fisheye, wide angle lens (12mm –18mm) to reduce the amount of total overlapping photos you need
- Working on the [CLI script for running AliceVision/Meshroom software](https://github.com/anthonyjclark/MeshroomCLI)
  - Learned about the Python script for the command-line photogrammetry pipeline during Monday meeting.
  - Starting to extend the code Prof. Clark had written to include more steps of the photgrammetry process.

# Future Plans

- Continue extending the python file until it produces the desired output.
