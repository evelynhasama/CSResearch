## Photogrammetry:

- Cameras:
  - After searching the Internet for which cameras to use for photogrammetry, the consensus seems to be on a **DSLR camera**. The DSLR camera will give you better resolution, sharpness and clarity because it uses a larger sensor than other cameras. The best DSLR cameras on the market are Canon or Nikon.

- Camera Lens:
  - People suggest using an approximately **28mm or 24mm (35mm equivalent) prime lens** for capturing photos of rooms and interiors. Typically lens of 50mm focal length (35mm equivalent) are used to photograph smaller objects. Lens below 22mm are not recommended.
  
- Image Capturing Process:
  - Camera Settings:
    - lowest ISO setting for minimal noise (Ideal ISO settings are in the range of 250 to 320)
    - keep your f/stop settings around f/8 to f/16 for best results or set your f/stop so the entire frame is in focus
    - use the manual setting or aperature priority or use the camera's sharpest aperature at your chosen widest fixed focal length
    - RAW image files are best
  - Tripod:
    - typically using a tripod (possibly with a remote) improves stability and reduce bluriness
    - tripods are also good when ambient lighting is low
    - when using a **tripod**, you can set a very slow shutter, ideal for revealing surfaces in darker environments
    - when shooting **handheld**, you can set a higher shutter speed of at least 1/200 or faster (or slower if youâ€™re steady with the camera)
  - Best Practices:
    - avoid capturing mirror-like or reflective surfaces, featureless white walls, glass
    - do your photography when the sun is highest in the sky or on an overcast day to minimize shadow
    - work as quickly as possible to capture your photoset to minimize shadow movement

 - Software
   - When looking into software, I found that some of the top photogrammetry software, including Meshroom, Reality Capture, 3D Zephyr, and Autodesk ReCap, are compatible with Windows computers and not MacOS. Since I have MacOS, this may limit the software we can use for the project.
   - For the software compatible with MacOS, the most popular appear to be COLMAP, Agisoft Metashape, Regard3D and MicMac. After reading reviews/articles on these software and visiting the websites, the most promising seem to be COLMAP (free) and Agisoft Metashape (commerical). 
   - **Agisoft Metashape** seems like the best software despite its price of $59 for a standard educational liscence. This stand-alone software has photogrammetric triangulation, dense point cloud generation and editing, and 3D model generation and texturing. Metashape seems to produce good quality results with many different formats for exporting. "Metashape has the capability to split the set of photos, manually remove extra point clouds and also has some nice extra features such as the ability to automatically close holes and directly export to Sketchfab."
   - COLMAP is a free open source software that also produces good results, but it does not do texturing or allow users to adjust the 3D mesh. Thus, the use of additional software such as MeshLab may be necessary to create a higher quality photogrammetric model.

# Future Plans

- Further research software-specific photogrammetry techniques.
- Research HDRI processes.
- Begin photographing and possibly constructing the photogrammetric model.
