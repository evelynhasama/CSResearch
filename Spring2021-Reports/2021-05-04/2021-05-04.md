# Activities

## Photogrammetry:

- **Recreated photogrammetric model of an guest room/office using command-line Meshroom.**
  - took 61 more photos to include the floor and ceiling
  - photos taken can be found [here](https://github.com/evelynhasama/meshroomTesting)
  - **bathroom: (taken inside around 3:00pm with mirrors covered)**
    -  command: ~/.local/Meshroom-2020.1.0/meshroom_photogrammetry --cache $HOME/cache --input meshroom/meshroomTesting/guestoffice/ --output models_guestoffice2 --paramOverrides FeatureMatching:guidedMatching=1 DepthMapFilter:minNumOfConsistentCams=2 DepthMapFilter:minNumOfConsistentCamsWithLowSimilarity=3
    -  number images: 377
  
- **Opened in MeshLab** 
    - rendered color in User-Def, Shading set to None, Back-Face set to Cull (to see through nearest wall) 
    - <img src="https://github.com/evelynhasama/CSResearch/blob/master/Spring2021-Reports/2021-05-04/guestoffice1.png" width=300> <img src="https://github.com/evelynhasama/CSResearch/blob/master/Spring2021-Reports/2021-05-04/guestoffice2.png" width=300>
    - Ceiling: <img src="https://github.com/evelynhasama/CSResearch/blob/master/Spring2021-Reports/2021-05-04/guestoffice3.png" width=300>
    - Seems to have matched poorly, likely due to the different day and features of the recently added photos
