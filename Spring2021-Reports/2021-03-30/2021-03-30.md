# Activities

## Photogrammetry:

- **Created photogrammetric model of two items using command-line Meshroom.**
  - photos taken can be found [here](https://github.com/evelynhasama/meshroomTesting)
  - photo properties on iPhone XR:
    -  dimensions: 3024 × 4032 
    -  exposure: f/1.8
    -  exposure time: 1/3,521
    -  focal length: 4.25 mm
  - **bathroom: (taken inside around 1:30pm with mirrors covered)**
    -  command: ~/.local/Meshroom-2020.1.0/meshroom_photogrammetry --cache $HOME/cache --input meshroom/meshroomTesting/bathroom/ --output models_bathroom
    -  number images: 538 
    -  time to create the model: **approx 2 hours**
  
- **Opened in MeshLab**

## Issues
  - the vertices of the model did not have color when in MeshLab

# Future Plans

- Learn how to improve the quality of Meshroom models, perhaps by changing construction parameters.
- Learn how to clean up models more with Meshlab
