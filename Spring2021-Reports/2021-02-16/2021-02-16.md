# Activities

## Photogrammetry:

- Searching for Pomona College/Claremont Colleges equipment to borrow:
- **Pomona College ITS**
  - Emailed the ITS Service Desk about what they have in the ITS Loaner Pool
  
- **Claremont Colleges Library**
  - Available Cameras and Quantities:
    - [Canon EOS Rebel T6 with 18-55mm lens (1)](https://ccl.on.worldcat.org/oclc/957364298)
    - [Canon EOS 70D DSLR with 18-135mm lens (2)](https://ccl.on.worldcat.org/oclc/957352639)
    - [Canon EOS 80D DSLR with 13-135mm camera lens (1)](https://ccl.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1112673177)
  - According to comparison articles between the three cameras, **Canon EOS 80D DSLR** is the best, as it exceeds the capabilities (image quality, feautures, etc) of the other two, except for in portability.


# Future Plans
