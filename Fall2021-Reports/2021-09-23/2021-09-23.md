# Activities

## Photogrammetry:

- **Farm Photos**
  - Reviewed Prof. Los Huertos meshes by opening them on Meshlab
    - Pomona Farm_West2_April_2019.zip > Pomona Farm_full > Pomona Farm > 2_densification > 3d_mesh > Pomona Farm_simplified_3d_mesh.obj

- **Vuze**
  - charged it up :)
  - notes on using the Vuze 3D 360 Spherical VR Camera:
    - Vuze Camera Mobile App: The Android and iOS mobile apps can control the camera and review captured media.
    - Vuze VR Studio Software: Vuze VR Studio can be installed on computer and activated using your Vuze Camera. Each camera grants you a license to install the software on 5 computers. Software has automatic VR generation with proprietary stitching technology.
    - The camera records everything to a microSD card
    - battery life is 1-2 hours depending on model
    - Seems like 3D videos is the main use
   - watched some tutorials

- **Potential Places to Model**
  - ideal qualities: featureless walls, minimal reflective surfaces, no windows or mirrors
  - Mudd dorm hallway
    
- **Reality Capture and Meshroom.**
  - Meshroom:
    - Meshroom is a free open-source software that provides great reconstruction quality
    - Produces results that take up large amounts of storage
    - Relatively slow processing speed
    - User-friendly interface
  - Reality Capture:
    - Reality Capture is a commercial software that also provides great results
    - It is one of the fastest processing softwares available
    - Produces good results with both small and large image or laser scan sets
    - Easy to use, very intuitive interface 
   
# Future Plans
  - Test out the Vuze
  - Reconstruct the farm on Meshroom
  - Find potential places to model
